        <p class="bio">Dr. A P J Abdul Kalam (1931-2015) was an Indian scientist and politician who served as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, and had a humble upbringing. He studied physics and aerospace engineering and played a key role in India's civilian space program and military missile development.

          Kalam was known as the "People's President" due to his down-to-earth demeanor and his willingness to engage with ordinary citizens. He was a popular figure in India and inspired many young people to pursue careers in science and technology. Kalam was also a prolific writer and authored several books, including his autobiography "Wings of Fire."
          
          Despite his many achievements, Kalam remained humble and committed to his work. He was awarded numerous honors and awards throughout his life, including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian award. Kalam passed away on July 27, 2015, while delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management in Shillong, Meghalaya.</p>
